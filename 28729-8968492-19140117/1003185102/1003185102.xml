selections oC class by the famous grand orchestra, so here again is a demonstration of the early bird catching the worm. Mizpah Silbini opened the Ijill this week with a semi-juggling and dancing act that was only passable. Williams and Held, billed as a study in black and tan, had a neat little talking act that doubtless would have taken better in another house. It was on the order of Miller and Lyles' with the exception that it was a little coarser. They were received poorly and did not have a chance to respond to an encore to show they were a white team, ( and Mack,      Italian organ grinder and singer, had a good turn and a novel one in many ways. Cook and Stevens are prime favorites and were easily the hit of the bill. Cook's make up as a Chinaman was capital, as was his impersonation of (heir mannerisms. Stevens is an artist in his line and -together they made a combination hard to beat. Went worth, Vesta and Teddy, two people and ' a dog, unique gymnasts and athletes - including the dog - were good and the audience showed their appreciation by generous applause. Beginning Monday an exceptionally good bill will be offered for the week.
